## üöö Incoming Shipments/ASN Workflow (User & Admin Guide)

1. **Create ASN**: Add a new incoming shipment with all required details.
2. **Receive Items**: On the Inventory page, add items received for the shipment. Items are tracked and summarized before submission.
3. **Return to Shipment**: Submits received items to the backend, updates shipment status to "Arrived" or "Processing" (if discrepancies), and returns to the shipment detail view.
4. **Complete Shipment**: If you have the Warehouse, Manager, or Admin role, and items have been received, you can mark the shipment as "Added to Stock". This triggers an email notification with details and discrepancies.
5. **Completed Shipments**: Shipments marked as "Added to Stock" remain visible in a dedicated section for 60 days.
6. **Reporting**: Use the Reporting page to review all incoming shipments by month/year, including status, items, and any discrepancies.

**Note:** Only authorized roles can complete shipments. Discrepancies are highlighted and included in notifications.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting & Migration Notes

- **Error: column "completed_at" of relation "asns" does not exist**
  - This means the database migration to add the `completed_at` column was not applied.
  - **Solution:** Run the migration:
    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE asns ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS completed_at TIMESTAMP NULL;
    ```
  - Always run database migrations after pulling updates or deploying new features.

- **Real-time/Status Issues**
  - If shipment status does not update after receiving, ensure the backend is called and the frontend refetches the latest ASN data.

- **User Feedback**
  - The UI now provides clear error messages if you try to complete a shipment without receiving items, or if items cannot be matched to inventory.
